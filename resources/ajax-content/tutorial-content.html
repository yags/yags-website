<h1 class="content-title">A Gentle Tutorial</h1>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you already installed <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>; and that you have some basic understanding of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>: user interface, the read-eval-print loop, arithmetic operations, and lists. It is strongly recommended that you have some <em>working directory</em>, <code class="file">WORKING-DIR</code>, different from your <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>'s and <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>'s installation directories. For instance, if your home directory is <code class="file">/home/joe/</code> your working directory could be <code class="file">/home/joe/Yags/</code>. Then you should open a terminal, move to your working directory, start <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and then, load <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
/home/joe&gt; cd Yags
/home/joe/Yags&gt; gap
   --- some GAP info here ---
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">RequirePackage("yags");</span>

</pre></div>

<p>The exact appearance of your system prompt (<code class="file">/home/joe&gt;</code> and <code class="file">/home/joe/Yags/&gt;</code> in the example) may be different depending on your system, but the commands '<code class="file">cd Yags</code>' and '<code class="file">gap</code>' are actually the same in all supported systems (assuming your working directory exists and is named '<code class="file">Yags</code>'). From there (starting with the command '<code class="file">RequirePackage("yags");</code>') everything happens within <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and hence it is system-independent.</p>

<p>Now we want to define some graph. Say we have the list of edges of the desired graph:</p>

<p class="pcenter">{ { 1, 2 }, { 2, 3 }, { 3, 4 }, { 4, 1 }, { 1, 5 }, { 5, 4 } }</p>

<p>We can put those edges in a list and then construct the graph:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">list:=[[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,1],[1,5],[5,4]];</span>
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 4, 1 ], [ 1, 5 ], [ 5, 4 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=GraphByEdges(list);                      </span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ], 
  [ 1, 4 ] ] )
</pre></div>

<p>Note that <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> uses brackets ('<code class="file">[</code>' and '<code class="file">]</code>') instead of braces ('<code class="file">{</code>' and '<code class="file">}</code>') to represent sets and lists (actually, in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> a set is simply an ordered list). Note also that in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> '<code class="code">list</code>' and '<code class="code">List</code>' are two different things and you can not use the latter since it is a reserved word of <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>. In general, it is better for you to use lowercase names for your variables, to avoid name clashes, since all functions in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> and <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> start with an uppercase letter.</p>

<p>The result in the previous example says that it is a graph, and a <em>simple graph</em>. By default all graphs in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> are simple (no loops, no arrows, no parallel edges, only plain undirected edges), in Chapter <a href="chap4.html"><span class="RefLink">4</span></a> we explain how to work with other types of graphs, like digraphs, loopless graphs, and graphs that may have loops (but no parallel edges are supported in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> at all). In this gentle tutorial all our graphs are simple.</p>

<p>The result also says, that the just constructed graph <code class="code">g</code> have <code class="code">5</code> vertices and <code class="code">6</code> edges. The reported list of adjacencies means that the vertex <code class="code">1</code> is adjacent (connected by an edge) to <code class="code">2</code>, <code class="code">4</code> and <code class="code">5</code>, that the vertex <code class="code">2</code> is adjacent to <code class="code">1</code> and <code class="code">3</code> and so on. To be sure, we can draw our graph and check if it is the intended graph:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Draw(g);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>A separate window appears with an editable drawing of the graph (but the graph itself is not editable here). On that window, type: '<code class="code">D</code>' (toggle dynamics on/off), '<code class="code">L</code>' (toggle labels on/off) and '<code class="code">F</code>' (fit graph into window) to obtain a nice drawing (the initial one is random). The full list of keyboard commands for the <code class="code">Draw</code> window is displayed when typing '<code class="code">H</code>' (toggle help message). Besides these keyboard commands, you can use your mouse in obvious ways to edit the drawing.</p>

<p>To quit, type '<code class="code">S</code>'. The drawing is stored within the graph <code class="code">g</code> and remembered by <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> in case you want to draw the graph again.</p>

<p>If you are new to <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>, it may be worth mentioning that you need not remember or type all the full names of every <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> operation: <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> supports command completion. For instance, if you type <code class="file">Path</code> and then hit the <code class="file">&lt;TAB&gt;</code> key, <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> automatically completes the prefix to the unique command that completes it, namely: <code class="file">PathGraph</code>. If, on the other hand, the prefix has several possible completions, then <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> simply beeps, but a second <code class="file">&lt;TAB&gt;</code> makes <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> respond with a list of possible completions, so you can then type some additional keys and perhaps type <code class="file">&lt;TAB&gt;</code> again, and so on.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">GraphBy&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;</span>
    GraphByAdjMatrix
    GraphByAdjacencies
    GraphByCompleteCover
    GraphByEdges
    GraphByRelation
    GraphByWalks
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">GraphBy</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Also, the <code class="file">&lt;UP&gt;</code> and <code class="file">&lt;DOWN&gt;</code> keys are useful to bring back (and perhaps edit) some commands typed earlier in your <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> session. As with any command in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>/<strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>, in case of doubt, you can always access the online help by typing:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">?yags:draw</span>
Help: several entries match this topic - type ?2 to get match [2]

[1] yags: Draw
[2] yags: Drawing
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">?1</span>
  B.1-55 Draw
  
  ‣ Draw( G ) ───────────────────────────────────────────── operation
  
  Takes a graph G and makes a drawing of it in a separate window. The
  user  can  then  view  and  modify the drawing and finally save the
  vertex coordinates of the drawing into the graph G.
  
  --- many more lines here ---
</pre></div>

<p>Here, '<code class="code">?</code>' specifies that we want help; '<code class="code">yags:</code>' specifies on which manual book we want to search (<strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong>'s book in this case) and '<code class="code">draw</code>' specifies the topic we would like to be informed about. As it is common, there are more than one place with information on our topic, hence we choose among the options with '<code class="code">?1</code>' in the next command line. It is not necessary to specify the book, but then you could receive many more options, in different books, about some specific topic.</p>

<p>Now that we know that our graph is the one we want, we can ask <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> a lot of things about it:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Order(g); Size(g); Diameter(g); Girth(g);</span>

[ 1, 3, 5 ]
[ 2, 4 ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">VertexDegrees(g);VertexDegree(g,4);VertexDegree(g,3);</span>

[ [ 1, 4, 5 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CompletesOfGivenOrder(g,2);           </span>
[ [ 1, 2 ], [ 1, 4 ], [ 1, 5 ], [ 2, 3 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 4, 5 ] ]
</pre></div>

<p>Note that in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> a <em>clique</em> is always <em>maximal</em>. This is just a small sample. The full alphabetic list of <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> operations can be found in Appendix <a href="chapB.html"><span class="RefLink">B</span></a>, and grouped by topic in Appendix <a href="chapA.html"><span class="RefLink">A</span></a>. There is also a one-page pdf file, <code class="file">cheatsheet-yags.pdf</code>, which contains a very useful synopsis of many of the most common <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> operations. See the next section (<a href="chap2.html#X7AC1C7197E9E9112"><span class="RefLink">2.4</span></a>) for details.</p>

<p>What about <em>modifying</em> our graphs? Well, all graphs in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> are always immutable, which means that, once created, we can never modify a graph. But we can create new graphs which are variations of existing ones:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g;</span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ], 
  [ 1, 4 ] ] )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h:=AddEdges(g,[[1,3],[2,4]]);;  </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g;</span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 1, 3, 5 ], 
  [ 1, 4 ] ] )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">h;</span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
8, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 4 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ], [ 1, 4 ] ] )
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the graph <code class="code">g</code> remains the same, but the graph <code class="code">h</code> has two additional edges. This is done in this way, because in <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> everything that is computed about a graph is stored within the graph, so that we never need to compute something twice. This saves time when computing attributes of graphs requiring CPU-intensive algorithms (like computing cliques and clique graphs), but at the expense of having to make a copy of the graph when we just want a small variation of it.</p>

<p>There are a lot of predefined graphs (the full list can be consulted in Appendix <a href="chapA.html#X82B05AAB844DD947"><span class="RefLink">A.4</span></a>):</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">PathGraph(5);CycleGraph(6);CompleteGraph(5); </span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
4, Adjacencies := [ [ 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 3, 5 ], [ 4 ] ] )
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 6, Size := 
6, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 6 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4 ], [ 3, 5 ], [ 4, 6 ], 
  [ 1, 5 ] ] )
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 5, Size := 
10, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 2, 4, 5 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 3, 5 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ] )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">CompleteBipartiteGraph(3,3);TreeGraph([2,2,2]);</span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 6, Size := 
9, Adjacencies := [ [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 1, 2, 3 ] ] )
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 15, Size := 
14, Adjacencies := [ [ 2, 3 ], [ 1, 4, 5 ], [ 1, 6, 7 ], [ 2, 8, 9 ], 
  [ 2, 10, 11 ], [ 3, 12, 13 ], [ 3, 14, 15 ], [ 4 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ], 
  [ 5 ], [ 6 ], [ 6 ], [ 7 ], [ 7 ] ] )
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">Octahedron;ParapluieGraph;</span>
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 6, Size := 
12, Adjacencies := [ [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], [ 3, 4, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 2, 5, 6 ], 
  [ 1, 2, 5, 6 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ], [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ] )
Graph( Category := SimpleGraphs, Order := 7, Size := 
9, Adjacencies := [ [ 2 ], [ 1, 3 ], [ 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 ], [ 3, 5 ], 
  [ 3, 4, 6 ], [ 3, 5, 7 ], [ 3, 6 ] ] )
</pre></div>

<p>We have found that <code class="func">GraphByWalks</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X790CBDC282E6FEA1"><span class="RefLink">B.7-11</span></a>) is one of the most useful and versatile ways of specifying graphs:</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">p5:=PathGraph(5);;c6:=CycleGraph(6);;w4:=WheelGraph(4);;  </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(p5,GraphByWalks([1..5]));</span>
true
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(c6,GraphByWalks([1,2,3,4,5,6,1]));</span>
true
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(c6,GraphByWalks([1..6],[6,1]));   </span>
true
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(w4,GraphByWalks([1,[2,3,4,5,2]]));</span>
true
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">sd:=GraphByWalks([1,[2,3,4,5],6],[5,[6,7,8,1],2]);; </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">IsIsomorphicGraph(SnubDisphenoid,sd);</span>
true
</pre></div>

<p><strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> knows about random graphs, so you can take some random graphs and study their parameters. Furthermore, <code class="func">GraphAttributeStatistics</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X84BA39B986A7A8F7"><span class="RefLink">B.7-4</span></a>) can collect statistics on 100 random graphs at a time returning the collected results of the specified graph parameter on these graphs. The following experiments show, for instance that the values of the minimum degree parameter are much more spread than those of the clique number or those of the diameter.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">MinDeg:=function(G) return Minimum(VertexDegrees(G)); end;;</span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">g:=RandomGraph(30,1/2);; MinDeg(g); CliqueNumber(g); Diameter(g);</span>
9
6
2
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">GraphAttributeStatistics(30,1/2,MinDeg);</span>
[ [ 5, 1 ], [ 6, 2 ], [ 7, 6 ], [ 8, 22 ], [ 9, 30 ], [ 10, 30 ], 
  [ 11, 5 ], [ 12, 4 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">GraphAttributeStatistics(30,1/2,CliqueNumber);</span>
[ [ 5, 2 ], [ 6, 70 ], [ 7, 24 ], [ 8, 4 ] ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">GraphAttributeStatistics(30,1/2,Diameter);    </span>
[ [ 2, 91 ], [ 3, 9 ] ]
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that algorithms the may take too much time to finish report their progress using the <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> mechanism: Enabling and disabling progress reporting is done by changing the <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> of <code class="code">YAGSInfo.InfoClass</code> to the appropriate level. The default <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> is 0. Some of <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> algorithms report at <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> 1, and others at <code class="code">InfoLevel</code> 3.</p>


<div class="example"><pre>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">SetInfoLevel(YAGSInfo.InfoClass,3);           </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">FullMonoMorphisms(PathGraph(3),CycleGraph(3));</span>
#I [  ]
#I [ 1 ]
#I [ 1, 2 ]
#I [ 1, 3 ]
#I [ 2 ]
#I [ 2, 1 ]
#I [ 2, 3 ]
#I [ 3 ]
#I [ 3, 1 ]
#I [ 3, 2 ]
[  ]
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">SetInfoLevel(YAGSInfo.InfoClass,0);           </span>
<span class="GAPprompt">gap&gt;</span> <span class="GAPinput">FullMonoMorphisms(PathGraph(3),CycleGraph(3));</span>
[  ]
</pre></div>

<p>This way we can abort the calculation (by typing <code class="code">Ctr-C</code>) in case we see that it will take eons to finish. See <code class="func">YAGSInfo.InfoClass</code> (<a href="chapB.html#X8602312E8239A2C0"><span class="RefLink">B.24-3</span></a>) for details.</p>
