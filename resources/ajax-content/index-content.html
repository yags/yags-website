<h1 class="content-title">Welcome to <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong></h1>

<section>    

<p><strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> - <em>Yet Another Graph System</em>
is a <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong> package for dealing
with graphs, in the sense of <a target="_blank"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">Graph Theory</a>
(not bar graphs, pie charts nor graphs of functions). Hence our graphs
are ordered pairs <span class="SimpleMath">\( G=(V,E) \)</span>,
where <span class="SimpleMath">\(V\)</span> is a finite set of
vertices and <span class="SimpleMath">\(E\)</span> is a finite set of
edges which are (ordered or unordered) pairs of vertices.</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> is
a <strong class="pkg"><a target="_blank"
href="http://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a></strong> package and hence
its code is interpreted and not compiled (although some compilation
possibilities exist in <strong class="pkg">GAP</strong>). Therefore,
from the very beginning, it was clear that speed was not our main
goal. Instead, we wanted a very functional, full-featured system; a
system adequate for rapid prototyping of algorithms; and a quick,
easy-to-use, way for testing the rapidly changing working conjectures
that are typical of the research process.

<p><strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> was designed to be useful for
research in Graph Theory and <a target="_blank"

graphs</a>, it offers an ample set of functions
(Appendix <a href="doc/chapB.html"><span class="RefLink">B</span></a>);
a graph-drawing subsystem (<code class="func">Draw</code>
(<a href="doc/chapB.html#X7DF9F3AD86602DFC"><span class="RefLink">B.4-15</span></a>));
many methods for dealing with graph homomorphism
(Chapter <a href="doc/chap5.html"><span class="RefLink">5</span></a>);
an Object-Oriented approach that simplifies the task of working with
several different graph categories
(Chapter <a href="doc/chap4.html"><span class="RefLink">4</span></a>);
and a generic backtracking subsystem useful to solve many
combinatorial problems easily
(Chapter <a href="doc/chap6.html"><span class="RefLink">6</span></a>).</p>

<p><strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> was initiated by M.A. Piza√±a</a>
in May 2003, and then incorporated the work of R. MacKinney-Romero,
R. Villarroel-Flores, C. Cedillo and I.A. Robles
(see <a href="http://xamanek.izt.uam.mx/yags/authors.html">Authors</a>
for details).  It sprang from our need of computing graphs and
graph parameters within our research on graph theory and clique
graphs. </p>

<p>Over the years, <strong class="pkg">YAGS</strong> grew to its
present size of more than 200 methods and more than 10 thousand lines
of code. We considered that all this code and effort could (and
should) be useful for other people and then we decided to engage in
the task of tying up loose ends, writing the manual and building this
website.</p>
